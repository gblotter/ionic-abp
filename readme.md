#Ionic-abp  

This is a playground, of sorts, to see how I like Ionic.  I'm applying it to the areabook application that I develop at work in Sencha Touch.  The origional app is already a Native-Hybrid application that is wrapped in Cordova, so it should be able to transfer over quite nicely

###Goals  

- Prove out/test Performance  
- Get a feel for the AngularJS & Ionic Frameworks
